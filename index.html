            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began, at the very core, with a program called Linux kernel. Then, Linux kernel merged with Bitkeeper in the early 2000’s. This went well for a while, but then Bitkeeper decided to change the program so it was no longer free of charge, among other things. From there, Linux decided to start designing Git. All ideas stem from other ideas and this case rings true for Git. It started with using these programs and recognizing the flaws and wanting to fix them to the best of their ability.  It has a history going all the way back to the early 2000’s, making it’s way to what there is today.

</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">First in initializing a repository in an existing directory, you need to go to your repository and then type ‘git init’ after the $ to create a new sub directory, .git. To start tracking those files, type ‘git commit’ after the $ in the terminal. To clone an existing repository, use the command, ‘git clone’. If you type this followed by the url, it will make a copy. This takes every single type of every single file and pulls it out. This makes it so that if your server is corrupted, all of the data will still be there that was there when you cloned it.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Other version control systems have a file based system. They treat changes in information like they are file based changes. Git thinks of the data that it stores as “snapshots of a miniature file system.” This way, if a file hasn’t been altered, Git doesn’t end up storing it twice, it only stores the new files that have been changed. Git stores the unaltered files as merely a link to the url of the file since it has already stored it once. This is a much quicker data storing process than other version control systems. Because it is so much more powerful in this way, it is barely considered a version control system.

                <span class="text-muted">Git’s three main states</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The three main states that your files can be stored in are committed, modified, and staged. The first of these three, committed, is when your data is stored in your local repository. The second, modified, is when you have made the changes you want to the file but you have yet to commit it to the database. The third of these, staged, is when you have already made changes to a file and you are getting ready for that version of it to go into your next commit snapshot. The three main sections of a Git project are the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. You make the changes you want to in the working tree, you stage your files in the staging area and you commit files into your Git directory.

</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using Git, after you have run the command, ‘git add’ after the $ on the files you have changed, you have to commit the files. This is done by using the command, ‘git commit’ after the $ in the terminal. Doing this launches your editor, which lets you know the status. After your commit message, you need to type a comment of what you are committing. This is something simple that lets you know which files you were committing at a quick glance. You do this with the ‘-m’ flag followed by the comment that you wish to make.
